We did a security review of the API Marketplace preview link . 

Essentially we have two views 
1)	Publicly accessible link : http://preview-api-marketplace.sunlife.com/  
2)	Logged in link  after login using SSO  

For the public link we want to implement the below restrictions , we need to lower the access to only Sunlife internal network users  ( so this not logged in page , would be accessible only by Sunlife network users (Using VPN  )  

To achieve one we will provide you a 
1)	list of IP ranges from which the requests will come in  and 
2)	will also add a MRC header to the all requests which come to RAPID API AWS environment ( for sunlife) : something like x-sunlife-usr  

the same will be needed for the production environment.   

Nothing can be accessible publicly ( internet) for Sunlife API marketplace.   I will try to get this list to you and the implemented header at our end by next week .   ( also raised requests to get the data)
